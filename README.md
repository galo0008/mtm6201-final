# The Pet House — Final Project (mtm6201-final)

## Overview
This website was built as my final project for Web Development II. My goal was to create a friendly adoption site that feels warm and easy to browse. I wanted the layout to stay consistent across all pages, with small animations that make the experience feel alive without being distracting.

---

## Process
I began by using my UX designs as a guide, then built each page with Bootstrap. I focused first on the structure, then added my colours, images, and animations. Reusing the same header and footer on every page helped keep everything tied together.  
The decorative icons, responsive images, and spacing took the most trial and error, especially when adjusting for smaller screens.

---

## Challenges I Faced
I struggled the most with positioning and animations. Some animations didn’t behave the way I expected, and a few small CSS edits kept shifting elements around, especially the pet cards and background icons. It was frustrating, but slowing down and testing changes step-by-step helped a lot.  
AOS also saved me time because it made scroll animations easier to control.

---

## What I Learned
This project taught me to plan structure first before styling anything. I learned how to combine Bootstrap with my own CSS without breaking the layout, and I feel more confident with responsive design, accessibility, and animation libraries. Overall, I learned how important patience is when everything breaks at the same time.
